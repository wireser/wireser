I develop backend-oriented software and technical tools across multiple environments and frameworks. My primary languages are Java, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, and C#, and I work frequently with Laravel for backend web applications. The majority of my work revolves around system reliability, data integrity, and long-term maintainability. I typically build systems to solve practical problems rather than to demonstrate complexity, and most of my work focuses on stability, scalability, and clean code structure.

## Minecraft Servers
I have operated Minecraft servers periodically since 2014. My goal has consistently been to provide a free, safe, and non-exploitative environment for players. The servers were designed to avoid pay-to-win models and instead provide gameplay through custom content and fair progression systems.
Beyond in-game management, I maintained supporting infrastructure including web forums and Discord communities, creating a unified environment for users to communicate, report issues, and participate in development feedback.
Currently, I maintain a private server used for plugin development and experimental testing. While it is not publicly available at this time, it remains under active development and may be released in the future when the supporting systems reach full stability.


## Minecraft Plugins and Modifications
I have written and maintained Minecraft plugins since 2014, primarily for Spigot and Paper-based servers. My work includes both independent development and the restoration of abandoned plugins that no longer receive updates from their original authors.
I have created larger “Essentials-style” systems that centralize server utilities into a single, maintainable plugin. Much of my work focuses on backend logic, configuration systems, performance optimization, and compatibility across multiple server versions.
In addition to development, I provide technical support and assistance through the Spigot forums, helping server owners troubleshoot configuration issues, incompatibilities, and plugin failures.

## Websites and Web Backend Systems
I create full-stack websites for small and medium-sized companies, with emphasis on backend development and data handling.
My work includes:
* Business websites
* Administrative dashboards
* Backend components for POS systems
* HR and employee management tools

Most of these projects rely on Laravel, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript. The priority is always maintainability: systems must operate without constant developer intervention, and non-technical users should be able to manage core functions independently.

## Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems
I have contributed to POS system development, specifically focusing on backend logic and database handling. These applications are built for reliability and low failure tolerance.
Many small businesses require software that does not depend on expensive external services or recurring licensing. My work in this space focuses on lightweight and stable functionality rather than unnecessary features or over-engineered interfaces.
